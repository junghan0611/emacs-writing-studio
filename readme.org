#+title: Emacs Writing Studio
#+author: Peter Prevos

/Emacs Writing Studio/ (EWS) is a configuration for researchers and authors who want to use Emacs to write and publish articles, books and dissertations. EWS is also a forthcoming ebook and paperback, which is an expanded version of a [[https://lucidmanager.org/tags/emacs/][series of articles]] on my website.

This configuration follows the following principles:

- Stays as close as humanly bearable to vanilla GNU Emacs
- Leverage functionality in Emacs 29
- Standard keyboard shortcuts
- No configuration for writing code
- Centred around Org mode

I am currently working on an /Emacs Writing Studio/ book based on the website. The Org mode source code is available in the =documents= folder. The books is written with the EWS configuration and will be available as ebook and paperback when completed.

Feel free to raise an issue if you have any suggestions on how to enhance the configuration or like to see additional packages useful to authors.

* Install EWS
To install the EWS configuration, download the =init.el= and =ews.el= files from the GitHub repository and save them in the configuration folder.

The location of the configuration folder depends on your operating system and Emacs version. Type =C-h v user-emacs-directory= to identify its location in the popup help buffer. You can close this buffer by pressing =q=.

Copy both files from the EWS repository to this directory. EWS will activate after you evaluate the ~restart-emacs~ function or the next time you start the program.

If you an experienced Emacs user, then you can try the EWS configuration by cloning this repository and start Emacs with =emacs --init-directory <folder-path>=. That way you can try EWS without clobbering your existing configuration.

* External Packages
Emacs is not only a text editor but also an interface to other software. EWS depends on external software that Emacs interfaces with to do various tasks.

When EWS starts, a message will appear in the =*Messages*= buffer listing the missing software. Some of the listed packages are alternatives for each other, for example (=convert= or =gm=). The core functionality of Emacs will work fine without these, but some specialised tasks require assistance from this software.
