#+title:  Publishing Articles and Books with Org Mode Export
#+startup:      content
#+bibliography: ../library/emacs-writing-studio.bib

Emacs Org mode is an ideal tool for writing without distractions because working with plain text allows you to focus on content instead of design. While writing articles and books in plain text is pleasant and productive, it is not ideal for sharing your work. You can of course share your Org source files, but you will not find lot of folks who appreciate the power and subtlety of Emacs. 

Org mode can export your work to PDF for a printed book, a website or a word processor document. There are also additional packages that can export to other formats such as an ePub ebook. 

The first section in this chapter explains the basic principles of exporting Org mode content and how to configure the output. The remaining sections explain the specific settings to export to Office documents, PDF files for physical books, ePub files for ebooks, and presentations in PDF.

* Org Mode Export Principles
In section [[#sec:quickstart]] we have already seen the basic workflow of exporting an Org mode document to a webpage. Org mode can export to other formats, but relies on some external software.

- ODT (Word Processor): Relies on the =zip= program.
- DOCx (MS Word): The =zip= program and LibreOffice.
- PDF: Requires Libre Office for simple output or LaTeX for more complex documents.
- ePub: Requires the =zip= program as well.

The basic principle of exporting Org mode files to the desired format is that Emacs converts the text to the relevant format and connects it to a document class, CSS style sheet or other type of template. The template defines the typography and layout of the document. You don't need to know HTML or LaTeX, but it will certainly help with fine tuning the output. Your text file can also link to a local or global bibliography to manage citations. When exporting to PDF of MS Word, the exported file is passed to either LaTeX or LibreOffice to generate the final result  (Figure [[fig:export]]).

For example, if you create a website, any Org mode text surrounded by forward slashes (=/example/=) translates as ~<i>example</i>/~, while in LaTeX it becomes ~\emph{example}~. The HTML style sheet or LaTeX document class and preamble determine the way this syntax  looks in the final output (the "what you mean" in WYSIWYM). The default setting for this example is italic text, but it could be something different if the stylesheet or document class defined it as such.

Exporting an Org mode file in any format follows the same workflow and uses the export dispatcher. Start the export module with the ~org-export-dispatch~ function, which runs with the default =C-c C-e= keyboard shortcut. A new buffer pops up with a large number of options. The first letter you type determines the export format, and subsequent letters the specific options. Using =q= exists the export dispatcher. You will notice that Org mode provides a range of additional export format, which are not discussed in this book.

The remainder of this chapter discusses the myriad of options to control the export process and achieve the desired result. The next section discusses generic settings and the following sections discuss the intricacies of the various export formats.

The Org mode manual discusses all functionality available for exporting, which you can find with =C-h r org RET g exporting=.

** Document Settings
Each file within your manuscript can store metadata and configurations to assist with the process. Various settings control how Org mode exports your document, which you add to the front matter of your file, or you set them as global variable to modify all exports. Some generic export variables are:

- =#+title:= Document title.
- =#+author:= Author name (defaults to the content of the ~user-full-name~ variable).
- =#+date:= Date of publication

You can set the format of the export with the ~org-export-date-timestamp-format~ variable. This variable uses an encoding to determine how to display a date. For example, =%e %B %Y= means that it starts with the day (without leading zero), indicated by =%e%=, then the full name of the month (=%B=) followed by the year with four digits (=%Y=) and separated by spaces. The help page for this variable contains a link to a list of the available format strings. To set the exported date to an American format set this variable to =%B %e, %Y=, for example June 13, 2024.

The title, author and date are the basic bits of metadata. Each export format also uses specific variables in the front matter. You can obtain a template for exporting to your targeted format with the ~org-export-insert-default-template~, which inserts keywords for your Org file's front matter. You can also access this function trough the export dispatcher with =C-c C-e #=. It's perfectly fine to use more than one export format, although using this function more than once, but it will lead to some duplicates.

By default, Org mode saves the result of the export process in the same folder as the source document. The exported file has the same name as the source file but with a different extension. Exporting Denote Org mode files can as such create a filename conflict because you are effectively creating two files with the same identifier, so ideally you should change the name of the exported file. 

You can change this behaviour by adding ~#+export_file_name: <filename>~ to the header. The filename can be any string without file extension. You can save the exported file in another folder, but this might cause errors for certain formats.

** Numbered Section Settings
When you add =num= to the startup keyword, Org mode will number every heading (=#+startup: num=). The numbering appears in the Org file. Whether this numbering also appears in any published output depends on your export template.

Some publications don't number all headings, such as in the front or back matter of a book. You can exclude individual sections from the numbering system by setting the =:UNNUMBERED:= property for each heading, shown below. To add this property, type =C-c C-x p= (~org-set-property~) and set the unnumbered property set it as =t= (true).

#+begin_example
  :PROPERTIES:
  :UNNUMBERED: t
  :END:
#+end_example

** Table of Contents
Org mode adds a table of contents to every exported manuscript by default. You can toggle this behaviour by customising the ~org-export-with-toc~ variable.

The behaviour for a table of contents can also be modified for each manuscript by adding the =#+options:= keyword to the front matter, for example:

- =#+options: toc:2=: Only include two levels in the table of contents.
- =#+options: toc:nil=: Don't export a table of contents.

Org mode inserts the table of contents directly above the first headline of the file. The chosen export format defines the design of the table of contents.

Org exports tables without vertical lines




[cite:@chicago_2017 section 3.53]. Org exports tables without vertical lines, but occasionally vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups of columns. To specify which columns form a group, use a special row where the first field contains only a forward slash (=/=). The other fields either contain a lesser-than symbol (=<=) to indicate that this column starts a group, or a greater-than (=>=) symbol to indicate the end of a column. Using =<>= inside a column makes it a separate group so it is surrounded by vertical lines.

** Structure Templates
Org mode structure templates are predefined bits of text that help to quickly insert commonly used text structures. They streamline your workflow by reducing the amount of repetitive typing you need to do. You have already seen a structure template for notes in the previous chapter.

In more general terms, a structure block is a part of your text that is treated differently than the main text. The structure templates most relevant to the topic of this book are: quotations, verse and centred text. These structure templates instruct 

The best advice to any writer is to use original words when expressing your thoughts. However, sometimes the other authors' words are so powerful they need to be quoted. The most direct way is obviously using "quotation marks".

Most export formats define a separate typography for quotations, for example by indenting the paragraph or using an italic font. You can instruct Org mode to use the quotation structure template. A quotation block is added with =C-c C-, q=.

#+begin_example
 #+begin_quote
   Good writing is essentially rewriting (Roald Dahl) 
 #+end_quote
#+end_example

** Citations
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: sec:citation-export
:END:
Org mode has a built-in citation manager that can use BibTeX / BibLaTeX or CSL files to reference bibliographic items such as articles and books. Chapter [[#chap:inspiration]] explained how to create a bibliography and chapter [[#chap:production]] explained how to add citations in Org files. This section explains how Org mode converts these technical constructs such as =wittgenstein_1922_tract= into a formatted citation such as "(Wittgenstein, 1905)". A long list of citation styles exists and each publisher and university, or even individual lecturers, insist that authors use their preferred style. Org mode has two mechanisms to convert citation links to formatted citations.

When exporting to LaTeX or PDF, Org mode translate citations in to LaTeX commands, such as =\cite{wittgenstein_1922_tract}=. The LaTeX preamble for the exported document sets the citation style which determines the final format of these citations. When exporting to any other format you need to specify how Org mode manages citations using a Citation Style Language (CSL) file. This language consists of =.CSL= files that contain instructions on how to format citations and bibliographies. You can find =.CSL= files for the citation style you require on the =citationstyles.org= website. When using CSL, Org mode converts the citation links to formatted text during the export process.

EWS is configured for LaTeX exports to use its native citation engine and any other documents iuses CSL The documents folder contains the =apa.csl= file, which was used for creating the non-PDF versions of this book.

The default settings in Org mode provide basic citation support in author-year format.

This website by Tecosaur provides an in-depth description of how to [[https://blog.tecosaur.com/tmio/2021-07-31-citations.html][manage citations in Org mode]], much better than I can explain it.

To active the list of references in the final result add the following to its nominated location:

#+begin_example
 #+PRINT_BIBLIOGRAPHY:
#+end_example

** Excluding Content from export
Not everything you write should be exported. Org mode exudes any comments as discussed in section [[#sec:notes]]. The /Emacs Writing Studio/ configuration does not export drawers, so your notes remain private.

Furthermore, you can also exclude a section of your writing from export by adding the =:noexport:= tag to a heading with =C-c C-q= (~org-set-tags-command~). You enter the tag name in the minibuffer and you can use completion to find existing tags. The tag appears on the right side of the heading name between colon markers.

* Office Documents
The export function in Org Mode can export to the ODT format, which is compatible with MS Word, out of the box. The ODT export back-end relies on the =zip= program to create the final output

If you have LibreOffice installed, you can also create a =docx= file to make it easier for MS Word users to share in the joy of reading your writing. When you set this option, the export process will result in both an =odt= and a =docx= file. This same process can also result in a PDF file. You can change the output format by customising the ~org-odt-preferred-output-format~ variable.

The ODT export as some additional keywords to customise the output:

- =#+subtitle:= The document subtitle.
- =#+description:= and =#+keywords= are added to the exported file(s) metadata.
- =#+odt_styles_file:= Add the path to an LibreOffice style file (=ott= format)

Creating a LibreOffice style file is straightforward. Create a LibreOffice file and design it using the Styles menu (press =F11= in LibreOffice) and save as an =ott= file.

A LibreOffice file is essentially a =zip= file with an set of embedded =xml= files. Org mode extracts the =styles.xml= file embedded in your template file. You cannot use this method for templates (pre-configured content such as logos or standard text).

You can fine-tune how Org exports to OpenOffice to a great extent. For a detailed discussion on =odt= Export, read the online Org mode manual.

* Ebooks Export to ePub
Most ebook publishers use the ePub format for distribution. This file type is a ZIP file with your book stored as a website optimised for an e-reader. The =ox-epub= package adds this functionality to the Org export dispatcher. This package uses the built-in Org to HTML export to create the ebook, so you can use any of its features to fine-tune the output.

There are some additional export options that need to be set in your header:

- =#+uid:= a unique ID of the document, otherwise known as URI, could be a website or ISBN.
- =#+subject=:
- =#+description=:
- =#+publisher=:
- =#+license=:
- =#+epubstyle=:
- =#+epubcover=:

The default settings adds a postamble to the bottom of the last page with a timestamp, author and a HTML validation service. Adding =#+options: html-postamble:nil= to the Org file header removes these from your ebook.

Any LaTeX fragments are ignored in the export, which means that you have to convert them 

However, LaTeX math formulas are possible with the =tex:dvipng= option added to the options line in the front mater. This option converts any LaTeX formula to a PNG image, which is not ideal but readable.

The =ox-epub= package does not convert Org mode timestamps to a date format that complies with the ePub standard. You can correct this by removing the square brackets and the day and time from the timestamp.

The export process for ePub is not as forgiving with missing images. While you can export to HTML and PDF without any errors, your ePub will not render if any linked images are missing. 

Lastly, only use open image formats such as =.png= as some ebook readers cannot display JPG files and other proprietary formats. The ebook will look alright on your computer but might not pass any checks by a publisher.

* Physical Books with LaTeX PDF
Writing technical documents can be a bit more challenging than normal prose. Technical writers often present mathematical formulas, tables and images. LaTeX offers a variety of features like automatic numbering of equations and references, making it ideal for technical documents. It's also extensible, allowing for customisation through packages for specific needs. While Latex has a learning curve, it produces professional-looking documents and is widely used in academia and technical fields. The output of LaTeX documents is optimised for printed works, so it is also great for writing non-technical books.

LaTeX is a modified version of an older format called TeX, first released by computer genius Donald Knuth in 1978. Knuth developed this tool because he was unhappy with the way his publisher typeset the books he wrote. The original TeX language is quite complex, so Leslie Lamport developed the LaTeX variety, which basically is a collection of macros to simplify writing TeX [cite:@lamport_1994_latex].

The "Hello World!" example shown in the previous section would like this in LaTeX. It looks a bit less busy than the HTML version. In this example, the text specifies that this document will be formatted as an article, which is one of the many document classes. In LaTeX, instructions start with a backslash and a function name, with any parameters between curly braces.

#+begin_example
\documentclass{article}
\title{LaTeX Example}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
Hello world!
\end{document}
#+end_example

The AUCTeX Emacs package assists with writing and formatting LaTeX files. This package is not part of /Emacs Writing Studio/. Org mode has perfect export capabilities for LaTeX so you can take advantage of the lightweight markup of Org mode. The next chapter discusses exporting Org mode to LaTeX and other formats in detail.

LaTeX is a powerful typesetting system (pronounced “LAY-tek” or “LAH-tek”), especially for writing scientific and technical documents. LaTeX can convert your text into a beautifully designed PDF file for publishing an article, ebook or physical book. Many publishers of technical literature have LaTeX templates to comply with their style guide. 

You don’t necessarily need any knowledge of LaTeX to export to PDF. Still, it will certainly help if you like to fine-tune the design of your document. The basic syntax of LaTeX is easy to explain. Let's assume you have a straightforward Org mode file that looks like this:

#+begin_src org :tangle no
  ,#+title:  Example document
  ,#+author: Peter Prevos
  ,#+latex_class: book

  Minimum example for a Org mode document.
#+end_src

The Latex equivalent of this example is:

#+begin_example
\documentclass{article}
  \title{Example document}
  \author{Peter Prevos}
  \begin{document}
  \maketitle
  Minimum example for a LaTeX document.
  \end{document}
#+end_example

The LaTeX software can convert this document to a wonderfully formatted article due to the document class, which defines the typography and layout.

Writing documents directly in LaTeX can be confusing because you need to know its markup language, and your text is littered with backslashes, curly braces, and other syntactical distractions. Being productive as a writer requires focusing on the text’s content instead of how it looks. Org mode is the perfect LaTeX editor because it frees you from distractions and integrates perfectly with LaTeX.

To enable exporting Org mode files to PDF, you need to have LaTeX installed on your system. How to install LaTeX depends on your operating system, and your favourite search engine will point you in the right direction.

Keying =C-c C-e= to open the export dispatch, then =l p= creates and opens a PDF file. Other options are available to export the buffer to LaTeX or to save a PDF file without opening it.

To make the magic work, Org Mode converts your file to a =tex= file, after which the LaTeX software converts it to PDF. The system works out of the box without any configuration. With some configuration you can produce PDF files that are perfect for producing printed books.

** Text elements
Org mode converts headers to relevant LaTeX headers, and text becomes a paragraph. The relationship between the heading level in your Org file and LaTeX depends on how you configure the document class.

** Tables and images
Org mode converts images and tables to LaTeX floats. You can add specific attributes to these floats by using =#+attr_latex:=, as shown in the image example below:

#+begin_src org :tangle no
  ,#+caption: This is an example image caption.
  ,#+attr_latex: :width 5cm :options angle=90 :placement h
  [[directory/filename.png]]
#+end_src

Various parameters are available to determine how your table or image looks in the final output. The Org mode manual provides a detailed overview in [[https://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-Export.html][section 3.10]].

** LaTeX snippets
You can write simple LaTeX commands directly into your org file. For example, =\newpage= will add a page break. You can also place equations using dollar signs, for instance =$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$= results in $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$.

The =org-latex-preview= function (=C-c C-x C-l=) shows a preview of any LaTeX equations within the open buffer. The chapter on [[{{% ref ricing-org-mode.org %}}][Ricing Org mode]] introduces the =org-fragtog= package to automatically toggle between the plain text and the preview.

To create front and back matter, use the ~\frontmatter~ and ~\backmatter~ LaTeX commands in your Org file at the appropriate locations.

For more complex snippets, you need to use a structure template. Press =C-c C-, l= to insert a LaTeX source block. This LaTeX example creates an image using the picture environment. 

#+begin_src latex :tangle no :eval no
  ,#+begin_export latex
  \setlength{\unitlength}{1cm}
  \begin{picture}(10,10)(-5,5)
  \linethickness{1pt}
  \put(-2.5,0){\vector(1,0){5}}
  \put(0,-2.5){\vector(0,1){5}}
  \put(0,0){\circle{3}}
  \end{picture}
  ,#+end_export
#+end_src

The image will not appear in Org mode as it is generated by LaTeX and will only appear when exporting to LaTeX. Any LaTeX fragments, except for formulas, in Org mode files will only be visible when exporting to PDF. This means that if you like to export to multiple formats, you will need to replace these fragments with something that applies to all formats, for example an image.

** LaTeX Packages and Classes
By default, Org mode uses the article class and a set of default packages to export documents. Org mode provides three mechanisms to use LaTeX packages in your export:

1. In the header, using ~#+latex_header:~
2. Configuring the ~org-latex-packages-alist~ variable.
3. Configure the ~org-latex-classes~ variable.

The Org mode header can do a lot of the work. The example below specifies the book document class with A4 paper size. This example also specifies the Times fonts package. The last line tells Org mode to omit the table of contents from the export.

#+begin_src org :tangle no
  ,#+latex_class: book
  ,#+latex_class_options: [a4paper]
  ,#+latex_header: \usepackage{times}
  ,#+options: toc:nil
#+end_src

The ~org-latex-packages-alist~ variable defines the default packages that are used for every LaTeX export.

You can define more complex header configurations by changing the =org-latex-classes= association list. 

The example below adds the template for the American Psychological Association (APA) journals. This list's documentation provides all the details you need to configure packages and classes for your exports. The ~with-eval-after-load~ function ensures that this variable is only set once the LaTeX export function is loaded by Emacs. Note the double backslash instead of the single one in regular LaTeX syntax for compatibility with Emacs Lisp. 

#+begin_src elisp
  (with-eval-after-load 'ox-latex
    (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
                 '("apa6"
                   "\\documentclass[a4paper, jou, 11pt]{apa6}
                    \\usepackage[nodoi]{apacite}
                    \\usepackage{graphicx}
                    \\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
                    \\usepackage{times}"
                   ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                   ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}"))))
#+end_src

The last part of this association list specifies the mapping between Org mode and LaTeX headers. In this case, the highest level is associated with the section header, the second level with a subsection, and so on.

You can call this particular class by adding =#+latex_class: apa6= to your file header. This mechanism empowers you to define bespoke LaTeX classes to create a library of export options.

These three mechanisms allow fine-grained control over how your Org mode document is exported to LaTeX and PDF. The /Emacs Writing Studio/ configuration only uses the default settings for these variables because the possible use cases are too numerous to define a sensible default other than what is already available.

** PDF export configuration
The /Emacs Writing Studio/ configuration for PDF export defines the export process to ensure that bibliographies work appropriately. This configuration also cleans all temporary files that LaTeX creates so that only the exported file remains.

The HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the engine that drives the World Wide Web. Internet pioneer Berners-Lee specified HTML in late 1990. The example below shows a simple HTML file. In HTML, the markup is designated by angle braces (less than and greater than symbols). The indentation is not required, but helps with understanding the structure of the document, also called the DOM (Document Object Model).

#+begin_example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HTML Example</title>

Emacs has a built-in mode for editing HTML files. However, Org mode has perfect export capabilities for HTML so you can take advantage of the lightweight markup of Org mode. Chapter [[#chap:publication]] discusses exporting Org mode to HTML in detail.

Death by PowerPoint

Using Emacs to write presentations is not ideal, but it can be done. Being a text processor, any set of slides exported from Org mode will most consist of lists of text. Unfortunately, most presenters use their slides as speaker notes and rely on the dot points to keep their talk on track.

Various methodologies exist that can convert your Org mode files to a presentation, most of which require additional packages. This section explains how to create presentations as a PDF file using the LaTeX bearer document class.

The first line enables the Beamer specific commands for Org mode explained below. The next two lines set the LaTeX exporter to use the Beamer class and to use the larger font settings. Using large text is good as it minimises the amount of test that fits on a slide. Who has not seen a presenter revealing a new slide and say: "I know you can't read this but \ldots", so don't be like them and keep text on a slide to a minimum.

The following line sets the theme for the presentation.
