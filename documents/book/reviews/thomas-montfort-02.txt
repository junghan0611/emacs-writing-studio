1 00-emacs-writing-studio-ch-01-05
==================================

  Sorry for the delay reading the new chapters but month of may was
  short, many days off in France (family time !) but a lot of work too.

  The progression in difficulty is pleasant.  The new concepts are
  aborded with detailed explanations and we can use the examples from
  the github repository.  I spoted very few keyboards mistakes and maybe
  one error in function name.  The book is not about a method but really
  about the concepts of collecting (evven RSS with elfeed) and managing
  readings and ideas.  The part about emms is nice to have to show all
  the possibilitues of emacs.  The EWS configuration is clean and ready
  to use.  It's the book I would liked to have when I returned to emacs
  to record all my notes, work and writing technical documents.

  Thank you !
